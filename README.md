# Hackathon Caterpillar
At this hackathon, the goal was to propose a solution to the issue of water scarcity. Collaborating with the team, we presented an shower system, which instead of wasting water that remains unheated, this smart shower redirects it through solenoid valves into a secondary tank. Furthermore, the prototype stops water flow in the absence of anyone beneath the shower, ensuring optimal water conservation.


# Proposal
Our solution included the following:
- Functional prototype with Arduino, pumps, sensors and solenoid valves (programmed with Arduino)
- [CAD design](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e1c0fad38eb51b710241040b/w/15ff5aebf5c887ae65428475/e/6598c40e1380575e82b8edcb?renderMode=0&uiState=62e88e991e8eaf63aa726923) of the final product
- [Business plan](PlanEjecutivo.pdf) including estimated savings

  
# Interview 
Having achieved first place in this hackathon, our team earned the opportunity to participate in an interview with the entrepreneurship channel Bar Emprende, which was summarized in the magazine MIT Sloan Management Review.
